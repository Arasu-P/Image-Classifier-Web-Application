#Image Classifier Web Application

This project is a web-based image classification application built using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Machine Learning.
It allows users to upload an image through a simple web interface, detects a face in the image, and classifies it into predefined categories using a trained machine learning model.

The project demonstrates how to integrate a machine learning pipeline with a web application, covering both frontend and backend development.

 Features:

-Upload images using drag & drop (Dropzone.js)
-Face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascades
-Feature extraction using Wavelet Transform
-Image classification using a trained ML model
-REST API built with Flask
-Simple and responsive web UI
